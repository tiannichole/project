            Hello! My name is Nichole Tian and I'm currently a high school senior. 
            Next year, I will attend the University of Washington to study Statistics on the 
            Data Science track. Go Huskies!
            <br>
            <br>
            Throughout high school, I've participated in multiple clubs and activities.
            For the past four years, I've been a member of my school's Interact Club, a subset of Rotary International.
            At Interact, we volunteer around the community to put service above self.
            As a 4-year member, I've volunteered with homeless shelters, local parks, marathons,
            city events, environmental cleanups, food drives, farmers markets, libraries, and many more.
            My work with Rotary earned me the Distinguished Service Citation and Student of the Month award.
            <br>
            I also compete in Speech and Debate, where I'm the president of the club and captain of my event.
            I placed second in WA state for Public Forum debate, qualified for nationals twice, 
            won the district tournament twice, earned the Special Distinction Degree,
            received the Academic All American Award, and won Rookie of the Year, Most Improved, and Most Valuable Team Member.
            <br>
            I'm also involved with my school's book club, where I was voted the president. I organized the first ever
            used book drive at my school to raise money for our club and reduce the amount of books in landfills.
            <br>
            Furthermore, I'm a member of National Honor Society and the President of my school's chapter. As president, I help
            organize community service opportunities for students at our school.
            <br>
            <br>
            During the summer before my senior year of high school, I studied Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Genetics at Harvard.
            As a final project, I conducted research using the CDC's NHANES dataset to find the association
            between physical activity and mental health. During my time there, I also participated in the Harvard
            Summer Talent Show, where I performed "The Winner Takes it All" by ABBA on the piano.
            <br>
            <br>
            I've taken 7 AP courses while simultaneously earning an Associate's Degree at a local community college. 
            In addition, I've remained on the Dean's List at my community college during all quarters, received 
            a Letter of Commendation from the CollegeBoard for my performance on the PSAT, and became an AP Scholar for my AP courseload. 
            Finally, I also played tennis on my high school's tennis team.
            <br>
            <br>
            Recently, I was nominated and selected as a Student of Distinciton on the Community Service panel by the Greater 
            Gig Harbor Foundation. I was also selected for the 2023 STEM Signing Day hosted by Tallo and Boeing. 
            As I head to UW in the fall, I will participate in the Boeing Mentorship program to expand my knowledge of and experience with STEM.
